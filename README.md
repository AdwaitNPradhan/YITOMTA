# Welcome to my Expo app ðŸ‘‹

So as the name "YITOMTA" suggests, yesterday I thought of making this app and here I am.

I still don't know where to take this app but I guess I will just cram up whatever "Public APIs" that I find are interesting in here and hope I will be able to keep updating my app.

Feel free to fork or whatever you want to do with the app right, Hope you have a good time.

## Contents

Feels pretty empty in here

## Ideas

-   [ ] Add as many available APIs to the app with UI to make passing time fun
-   [ ] Find a really funny app and make it run on some intervals and toast the user with jokes, roasts etc
-   [ ] Maybe add a feature for other apps to share things to this app and store the contents like a bookmark?
